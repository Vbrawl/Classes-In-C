# Classes-In-C
In this repo we share a way to use OOP and classes in C programming language.



# How???
Just open the `classes.h`, `classes.c` and `main.c`

* `classes.h` contains the most important stuff.
* `classes.c` contains only the implementation of the methods.
* 'main.c` has a simple but sufficient, i guess, usage example.


# I still need help...
Then you can watch my video, I believe I explain it well enough xD.
